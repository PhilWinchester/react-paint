# React Paint

## Description

A simple React application for MS-Paint enthusiasts.

## Functionality

As a User

- Sign Up or Login to your profile. 
- Select a background image you would like to draw on.
- Choose a color from the color tool and draw on your image.
- Save your favorite images to your library.
- Retrieve, redraw and remove images from your library.

## App Use

Once the user is signed in to their account, the user can select a 
background. The user will also have the option to pick whatever colors 
they want to draw with, change the thinkness of the stroke, and clear the image.
Once the user is finished with their portrait they can publish it. 

They published image will be saved right next to the canvas. The image
can be viewed, edited or deleted whenever they are signed in.
